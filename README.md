I became interested in web development as a grade 12 student in 2017—most of all
in UI design and animation. I liked to stress myself in hard-code CSS designs and use
JavaScript to add more interactivity. We used WordPress, Apache, MySQL, and PHP
in our senior high project. We also used VB.NET to create simple programs. In
college, we created console applications using Java, and C#, and continued to the
next level of web development where we started to use frameworks like Bootstrap,
Flutter, Firebase, and React. In my 3rd year of college, I got my internship as a QA
tester for 400 hours and was luckily hired as a Freelance IT consultant (Frontend) for
1 year.
