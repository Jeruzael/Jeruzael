I became interested in web development as a **Grade 12** student in 2017, especially **UI design and animation**. I enjoyed challenging myself with **custom, hand-coded CSS** and used **JavaScript** to add interactivity. For our senior high project, we worked with **WordPress** and a typical web stack using **Apache, MySQL, and PHP**, and we also used **VB.NET** to build simple programs. In college, we created console applications in **Java and C#**, then expanded into modern web and app development using tools and frameworks such as **Bootstrap, React, Flutter, and Firebase**. In my third year of college, I completed a **400-hour QA testing internship** and was subsequently hired as a **freelance frontend IT consultant** for **one year**.
